# Frontend Master Clone

This project is a clone of the [Frontend Master](https://frontendmasters.com) website. It was developed during the construct week of Unit-3. The goal was to recreate the functionalities and pages of the original website.

## Description

The Frontend Master website is an online platform that offers a wide range of front-end courses. It aims to help individuals become experts in front-end development. In this clone project, we have successfully replicated various pages such as the landing page, signup page, login page, and more. Our focus was on creating a simple and attractive user interface while ensuring the functionality matches that of the original website.
